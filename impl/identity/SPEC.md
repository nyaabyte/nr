# NoReplacement Identity Server Implementation Standard

## Status

This document is NORMATIVE and defines the mandatory requirements for implementing Net compliant Identity Servers.

## Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are normative and must be followed as such.

## Identity Server Requirements

### Core Functions

Identity Servers MUST implement the following functions:

1. Network Management: MUST maintain authoritative list of active Instances and peer Identity Servers
2. Registration Processing: MUST validate and process Instance registration requests
3. Consensus Coordination: MUST participate in network consensus for delisting decisions
4. Message Forwarding: MUST forward and validate signed control messages
5. Migration Support: MUST handle Identity Server and Instance migration procedures
6. Data Coordination: MUST coordinate generic data transport operations
7. Federation Synchronization: MUST provide federation sync and catalog services

### Transport Requirements

- Protocol: HTTPS with TLS 1.3 (or [Betanet](../../simple/compliance/Betanet.md)'s equivalent as defined in [Net](../net/SPEC.md)) REQUIRED
- Certificate Validation: REQUIRED
- Application Signatures: REQUIRED (TLS insufficient alone)

## Schema Compliance Implementation

### Capabilities Advertisement

**GET /net/id/capabilities** (NRTF: capabilities/request)

- Purpose: Advertise server capabilities and supported schemas and versions
- Query Parameters: `type` (node or schema_providers or all) OPTIONAL
- Response Fields (ALL REQUIRED):
        - node_capabilities: Basic server capabilities
        - supported_schema_providers: List of supported schema provider strings such as "StreamingServer/1"
        - schema_compliance_matrix: Mapping of schema providers to supported operations and any version notes
- Caching: Response MAY be cached for up to 300 seconds

### Schema Processing Rules

For all data operations involving generic data:

1. Schema Validation: MUST check both `schema_provider` and `schema_version` fields for all generic data operations
2. Supported Processing:
    - MUST process data normally if the schema provider and version are supported
    - MUST validate data according to the declared schema rules
    - MUST perform indexing for public data when applicable
3. Unsupported Handling:
    - MUST forward data unchanged through federation
    - MUST NOT attempt to parse or validate data content
    - MUST maintain NRTF frame integrity during forwarding
4. Capabilities Awareness:
    - MUST publish supported schema providers and versions in capabilities
    - SHOULD consult peer capabilities when coordinating storage or search
    - MUST avoid storing custom or generic data locally unless the server is explicitly marked as compliant with the relevant schema provider and version

### Schema Storage Policy (Identity Servers)

- Identity Servers MUST explicitly blacklist schema providers and versions they refuse to store.
- If a schema provider or version is not blacklisted, the Identity Server MUST store generic data for it at least as an opaque, canonical NRTF frame with minimal metadata. Minimal metadata SHOULD include: `data_id`, `schema_provider`, `schema_version`, `visibility`, `received_at` (timestamp), `frame_hash`, and `origin` (sender identity where available).
- Processing and indexing of content remain limited to supported schema providers and versions. For non-supported but non-blacklisted schemas, the server stores the canonical frame and forwards it unchanged without attempting to parse or index content fields.
- Identity Servers MUST expose blacklisted schemas and versions via capabilities so peers can route accordingly.

### Aggregation and Validation (Receive, Publish, Sync)

When receiving generic data directly or via federation:

1. Verify NRTF signature, timestamp, and nonce replay protections.
2. Ensure `schema_provider` and `schema_version` are present. If missing, reject with SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED and do not store.
3. If the pair is blacklisted: drop the content and optionally record a rejection event with reason, do not forward.
4. If supported: validate against schema rules, store structured record, index public content, and forward as policy allows.
5. If not supported and not blacklisted: store the canonical NRTF frame and minimal metadata, do not parse content, and forward unchanged.

When publishing or returning catalogs and indexes:

1. Include public items. For supported schemas include schema-aware index data. For stored but unsupported schemas, include only minimal metadata such as identifiers, timestamps, and hashes, never content-derived fields.
2. Ensure signatures and integrity hashes are preserved end-to-end, never re-sign on behalf of the origin for content objects.
3. Respect capability hints from requestors (for example, preferred schema providers or versions) when filtering results.

When syncing with peers (pull or push):

1. Deduplicate by `data_id` and `frame_hash`.
2. Resolve conflicts by newer timestamp and then by lexicographic hash tie-break if timestamps are equal.
3. Validate signatures and discard frames with invalid signatures.
4. For supported schemas: perform schema-level validation before accepting updates. For non-supported but non-blacklisted schemas: accept and store the canonical frames without parsing content.
5. Do not propagate items on the blacklist.

## Minimal JSON Schema Snippets (Example)

RegistrationEnvelope:

```json
{
  "instance_id":"uuid7",
  "instance_url":"https://...",
  "api_version":1,
  "nrtf_schema_version":1,
  "timestamp":"2025-08-11T12:35:01Z",
  "nonce":"<32 hex chars>",
  "capabilities":{"stream":true},
  "connected_identity_servers":{"primary":"<fingerprint>"},
  "public_key":"<base64>",
  "transport_sig_alg":"ed25519",
  "proof_of_possession_signature":"<base64>"
}
```txt

Consensus Vote:

```json
{"poll_id":"uuid7","voter_type":"instance","voter_id":"uuid7","decision":"GUILTY","signature":"<base64>"}
```

## Example SIN_REPORT (NRTF)

```txt
api 1
schema 1
id report/instance 5f6e7d8c-... 
ts 2025-08-11T12:40:00Z
nonce 11112222333344445555666677778888
sigalg ed25519
pub base64:...
sig base64:...
msg :{
     instance_id "5f6e7d8c-..."
     offending_message_uuids :{ m1 "018f..." }
     original_message_content_hash "ab12..."
     original_instance_signature "base64:..."
     server_signature "base64:..."
     observed_api_version 1
     observed_schema_version 1
     server_timestamp "2025-08-11T12:39:58Z"
     integrity_hash "cd34..."
}
```

## Operational Notes

- All control POSTs require authentication (signed NRTF frames).
- Rate limiting: per IP and per public key fingerprint.
- Replay window: 5 minutes. Duplicate (nonce, pub) denied.
- Delisting: Follows quorum rules in `net/SPEC.md`.
- Migration: During alias window treat old and new ids as the same principal for rate limits and replay detection. Reject signatures made with old key if timestamp > alias_expires_at.
- Generic data: optional coordination (search index merge, simple catalog diffs).
- Federation: pull (GET catalog) or push (announce) deltas and newest timestamp wins.

## Data Transport Coordination

Search: merge keyword docs. Simple dedupe by data_id.  
Cache: accept hints. No guarantees.  
Federation sync: diff = list of (data_id, ts, hash). Conflict: choose higher ts then hash tieâbreak.
Schema compliance: Only process data for supported schema providers. Check capabilities before accepting data operations. Forward unsupported data unchanged to maintain network connectivity.

## Force-Deletion (Server Misbehavior)

If an Identity Server is found sinful (see Net spec) a SERVER_DELIST_NOTICE is distributed. Upon receipt, Instances remove it and keep its fingerprint in a revocation cache for the configured retention.
