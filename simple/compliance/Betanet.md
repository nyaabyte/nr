# Compliance with Betanet

*See [Raven Dev Team's Betanet documentation](https://ravendevteam.org/betanet/)*  
  
The ideals and protocols behind NR have been inspired by Betanet's spec and we aim to be compliant with their technology as it matures.  
  
Since NoReplacement is simply a mechanism of defining servers and relaying information between them, NR's layers (Identity Servers, Instances, etc) do not rely on a specific protocol to function and are usually compatible with a variety of data transport mechanisms, including Betanet's HTX and HTTP. In addition, to fill the gaps, NoReplacement Instances and Identity Servers may communicate and send data to each other directly, identified by their explicitly defined origin parameters.  
Since Betanet is also censorship-resistant and has a focus on data validation and decentralization, it aligns with and may even support NR's values and goals.

NoReplacement's Net, in combination with Betanet, acts as a robust index of many various connected services and facilitates data exchange, archival and decentralized, validated object storage between those services.
